A collection of reusable, synthesizable and well-documented FPGA IP cores written in VHDL.

This repository is intended to serve as a growing library of commonly used digital design components ranging from basic RTL building blocks to complete communication interfaces and DSP architectures.

Every module is designed with emphasis on:

- Reusability
- Parameterization
- FPGA-friendly RTL
- Production-quality coding style
- Comprehensive documentation
- Self-checking testbenches
- Verification-driven development

# Design Philosophy

Every IP in this repository follows a common design philosophy.

## RTL Design

- Fully synthesizable
- Vendor-independent where possible
- Generic and reusable
- Single clock domain whenever practical
- FPGA resource optimized
- Readable coding style
- Consistent naming conventions

---

## Verification

Each module includes a dedicated self-checking VHDL testbench.

Verification typically covers:

- Reset behaviour
- Normal operation
- Corner cases
- Boundary conditions
- Error conditions
- Functional assertions

Whenever applicable, simulation-only debug interfaces are used to enable exhaustive verification without impacting synthesized hardware.

---

## Documentation

Each IP contains:

- Design overview
- Interface description
- Timing behaviour
- Functional description
- Architecture explanation
- Verification notes
- Usage examples

---

# Coding Guidelines

The following conventions are used throughout the repository.

### Naming

| Item | Convention |
|-------|------------|
| Entity | lower_case |
| Architecture | rtl |
| Signals | snake_case |
| Processes | descriptive_name_pr |
| Constants | UPPER_CASE |
| Generics | UPPER_CASE |

---

### Reset Strategy

Unless otherwise specified:

- Synchronous reset
- Active High
- Single clock domain

---

### Numeric Types

Arithmetic operations use:

```
IEEE.NUMERIC_STD
```

Avoid use of:

```
std_logic_unsigned
std_logic_arith
```
